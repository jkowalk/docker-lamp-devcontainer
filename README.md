# Devcontainer for LAMP (Ubuntu, Apache, Sqlite, PHP) works with VSCode and Docker

I found this to be a very easy development environment for developing websites for running on my raspberry pi.
On windows all you need is Docker Desktop running and Vscode with the Remote Development extension pack.
Then you can open the folder in a container by clicking the button in the left bottom corner.
You can put your files right at the folder root.
[Here you can find a detailed tutorial on how to set it up.](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)

You can reach your website by typing localhost in your browser.
